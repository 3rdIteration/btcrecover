# *seedrecover.py* #

*seedrecover.py* is a seed recovery tool which can take a seed with one or more mistakes in it, and recover the correct seed if not too many mistakes have been made.

* Seed/Passphrase Recovery when you have a known address you have used for:
    * Bitcoin
    * Bitcoin Cash
    * Ethereum
    * Litecoin
    * Dash
    * Dogecoin
    * Vertcoin
    * Monacoin
    * And many other 'Bitcoin Like' cryptos
 * Seed/Passphrase recovery via Address DB (Where you don't need to know an address to search for) supporting:
    * Bitcoin
    * Bitcoin Cash
    * Litecoin
    * Vertcoin
    * Monacoin
    * Likely many other 'Bitcoin like' cryptos
    
It tested and confirmed that it doesn't currently work with addresses or AddressDBs with
* Zcash (Including zcash forks)
* Monero
* EOS
* Ripple
..
For some of these coins, the UI won't accept the address. For others (like zcash) it will accept it and simply fail to find an address.
**_I haven't exactly spent time confirming what doesn't work, so can add to this list as people test and report back.... I don't really plan to add explicit support for any altcoins that aren't in the top5 on coinmarketcap..._**

## Installation ##

Just download the latest version from <https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/archive/master.zip> and unzip it to a location of your choice.

Additional requirements are described below.

### Windows ###

 1. Follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md#python-27) to download and install Python 2.7.

 2. Open a command prompt window, and type this to install the required Python libraries:

        C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install coincurve==5.2.0 pysha3

### Linux ###

Most distributions include Python 2.7 pre-installed. Two additional Python libraries, coincurve and (for Ethereum wallets) pysha3 are required. For example on Debian-like distributions (including Ubuntu), open a terminal window and type this:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install coincurve==5.2.0 pysha3

### OS X ###

 1. Follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md#os-x) to download and install the latest version of Python 2.7.

 2. Open a terminal window (open the Launchpad and search for "terminal"). Type this and then choose `Install` to install the command line developer tools:

        xcode-select --install

 3. Type this to install the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library: 
 
        curl -O https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz
        tar xf gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz
        cd gmp-6.1.2
        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/opt/gmp
        make && make check
        sudo make install
        cd ..
        rm -rf gmp-6.1.2 gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz

 4. Type this to install coincurve and (for Ethereum wallets) pysha3:

        sudo pip install coincurve==5.2.0 pysha3


## Running *seedrecover.py* ##

In order to run *seedrecover.py*, you'll need these two things:

 * A good estimate of what your seed is, *and*

 * *One* of these four, in order of preference:
     1. for Electrum (1.x or 2.x), a copy of your wallet file (a wallet file using Electrum 2.8's new full-file encryption won't work here), *or*
     2. your master public key (sometimes called an *xpub*), *or*
     3. a receiving address that was generated by your wallet from your seed, along with a good estimate of how many addresses you created before the receiving address you'd like to use, *or*
     4. an "address database". If you don't have i., ii., or iii. from above, please see the [Recovery with an Address Database](Creating_and_Using_AddressDB.md) section below.

To start *seedrecover.py* on OS X, first rename the `seedrecover.py` script file to `seedrecover.command`. Aside from this, starting it is the same for every system: just double-click the `seedrecover.py` (or `seedrecover.command`) file. If you're asked about running it in a terminal, choose *Run in Terminal*. Next, you'll be asked a short series of questions:

 1. First you'll be asked to open your wallet file. If you have an Electrum wallet file, find it now - the rest of the steps will then be skipped. Otherwise, click `Cancel` to continue.

 2. Next, select your wallet type. If you're unsure of what to choose, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/issues/new) to see if your wallet software is supported. 

 3. Next you'll be asked for your master public key. If you don't have yours stored anywhere, click `Cancel` to continue.

 4. If you don't have your master public key, next you'll be asked for your addresses. Find as many of your addresses associated with this wallet as you can, and enter them here (separated by spaces). Addresses you created early in your wallet's lifetime are prefereable. If your wallet supports multiple "accounts" each with their own address list, only addresses from your first account should be entered here.

 5. If you entered addresses above, next you'll be asked to enter the "address generation limit". *seedrecover.py* works by generating one or more addresses based on each seed it tries. The generation limit is the number of addresses it generates for each seed. Generating fewer addresses will improve *seedrecover.py*'s speed, however if it generates too few, it will miss the correct seed entirely.
 
    For example, let's say you found and entered three addresses in step 4. If you're reasonably sure that all three were within the first 10 addresses ever created in your wallet, you should use `10` for the address generation limit.

Finally, you'll be asked for your best guess of what your seed is.
